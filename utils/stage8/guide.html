<p>
    Now that we have a sense of what each of the individual 
    parts of the error message tell us, we can move on to 
    understanding how we can use this information to correct
    our program.
</p>
<p>
    The most telling piece of evidence is that we have an 
    <code>IndexError</code> in our code, meaning that an 
    index we're using into our list is invalid. 
</p>
<p>
    As a result, we need to find a place in our code wherein
    we're indexing into a list, and investigate how we might
    be using an invalid index there. The error message 
    suggests that it's happening in one of three places:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Line 14: <code>pair_sum = lst[i] + lst[i + 1]</code></li>
    <li>Line 23: <code>print(sum_pairs(lst))</code></li>
    <li>Line 27: <code>main()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Before moving onto the next section, try figuring out 
    which of these lines might be incorrectly indexing into a list.
    Which of them is indexing into a list at all? 
</p>
