<p>
    The last portion of the Traceback suggested to us 
    that the error in the program's execution occurred
    during the execution of the <code>main</code>
    function.
</p>
<p>
    With this in mind, we can move up in the Traceback 
    once more, which gives us two final pieces of 
    information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first line tells us that the <code>
        main</code> function was called 
        in <code>sum_pairs.py</code>, on line 
        27, but not in a function, but rather 
        in the module (<code>sum_pairs.py</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
        The second line shows us the contents
        of the line of code in question. 
    </li>
</ul>
