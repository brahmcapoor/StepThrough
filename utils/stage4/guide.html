<p>
    The other important part of an error message--highlighted above--
    is the <i>traceback</i>. While this is undeniably the more 
    intimidating-looking of the two sections, it's perhaps your 
    single most powerful tool as you try to isolate the 
    problematic portion of your code.

    Fortunately for us, the traceback is particularly well structured 
    and with a firm grasp of that structure, a programmer can quickly 
    isolate what part of their code is causing the exception.
