<div class="text-center"><h2> Anatomy of an error message: the exception </h2></div><hr />
<p>
    Somewhat counterintuitively, we usually begin reading error messages 
    at the end. The last line of an error message--highlighted above--
    tells the programmer what went wrong. It consists of two parts: 
    the specific exception that occurred (in this case, an 
    <code>IndexError</code>), and then an explanation in English of 
    the problem (specifically, that an index into a list was out
    of the range of valid indices).
