<div class="text-center"><h2> Debugging with <code>print</code></h2></div><hr />
<p>
    You might be most familiar with <code>print</code>
    as a function that outputs information for a user 
    to read, but it's also an instrumental tool in 
    inspecting the state of your program and your variables
    as you debug a program. 
</p>
<p>
    As a reminder, our current task is to identify which 
    of the indices <code>i</code> or <code>i + 1</code> on 
    line 14 might be causing an <code>IndexError</code> in 
    our code. The problem that presented itself to us was 
    that we weren't certain which iteration of the <code>for</code> loop
    on line 13 the error was actually happening in. 
</p>
<p>
    Thus, it might be helpful for us to see how many times 
    the <code>for</code> loop is executed before the crash 
    occurs. In addition, since we're interested in the values 
    of <code>i</code> and <code>i + 1</code> as the for loop 
    progresses, we might want to see their values too. 
</p>
<p>
    Before moving to the next section, take a look at the 
    <code>for</code> loop. What might you want to <code>print</code>, 
    and when, in order to get some additional helpful 
    evidence?
