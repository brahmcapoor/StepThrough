<div class="text-center"><h2> Debugging with <code>print</code></h2></div><hr />
<p>
    The output from our <code>print</code> statement 
    provides a key piece of evidence: the program crashes 
    in the fourth iteration of the for loop, when <code>
    i=3</code>. 
</p>
<p>
    This means that the indices <code>i</code> and 
    <code>i + 1</code> are 3 and 4, respectively. 
    On line 15, we use these as indices into 
    <code>lst</code>, which is equal to <code>
    [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Before moving to the next section, try reasoning 
    about which of these indices is the problematic one. 
    Why is it problematic? What can we do to fix it?
