<p>
    While there isn't a single correct answer to the 
    question presented in the last section, the simplest 
    possible <code>print</code> that still provides 
    us with helpful output is to <code>print(i)</code>
    at the beginning of each iteration of the for loop. 
</p>
<p>
    Importantly, we do this <code>print</code> before we index into 
    the list on line 15. The program crashes on that line, 
    and we'd like to have the <code>print</code> execute before that 
    crash.
</p>
<p>
    Now, when we run the program, we see some additional output,
    highlighted in the terminal above.
