<p>
    With all that behind us, the fix is relatively simple: 
    rather than setting the upper bound of the call to 
    <code>range</code> to be <code>len(lst)</code>, 
    we set it to be <code>len(lst) - 1</code>. This 
    means that the maximum possible value of <code>i</code>
    is <code>len(lst) - 2</code> (or in the case of this 
    particular program, 2). Thus, the maximum value of 
    <code>i + 1</code> is <code>len(lst) - 1</code> (or
    in the case of this particular program, 3), which 
    remains a valid index.

    Running this modified program reveals to us the fruits 
    of our labor: the program doesn't crash, and more to the point, 
    gives us the correct output!
