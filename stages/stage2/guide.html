<p>
    Formally, we see error messages like this when our program 
    encounters a line of code that causes an error. There are 
    many different kinds of errors, some far more common than 
    others, each caused by a different kind of problem in the 
    program. 
</p>
<p>
    When such a problem occurs and causes an error, a program 
    does what is formally referred to as <i>throwing an exception</i>. 
    This means that the program stops attempting to run and 
    instead signals that it has run into an issue. There are 
    ways to catch such signals and deal with them gracefully,
    but typically throwing an exception simply halts the 
    program's execution and displays an error message in the 
    terminal.
