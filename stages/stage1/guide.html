<div class="text-center"><h2>A broken program</h2></div><hr />

<p>
    Here's a program you might reasonably be expected to write 
    in CS 106A, in which you implement a function, <code>sum_pairs</code>,
    that computes the sum of each pair of elements in a list. 
</p>
<p>
    The program on the left is a first attempt at solving the 
    problem, but unfortunately isn't quite right. Upon running the 
    program in the terminal, it crashes, producing the output 
    in the panel above. 
</p>
<p>
    That error message looks scary, but it's actually Python's 
    way of providing as much useful information as it can to help
    you diagnose and cure your program of its bugs. In this tutorial, 
    we'll review how to read an error message like this: which parts
    are important and equally, which parts you can safely ignore. 
    Once we've done that, we'll take a look at how we can use this 
    feedback to adjust and eventually fix our program.
