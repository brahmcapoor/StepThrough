    The problematic index is <code>i + 1</code>, which in the 4th 
    iteration of the <code>for</code> loop is equal to <code>4</code> 
    (remember, <code>i</code> starts off with a value of <code>0</code>).
    <code>lst</code> has 4 elements, so accessing <code>lst[i + 1]</code>
    is an invalid index and so causes the <code>IndexError</code>.

    In short, our problem is that we're running off the end of the list:
    specifically, that we're going through the loop one too many times. 
    Semantically, it's probably unnecessary that we even get there: our goal 
    in the function is to sum elements in the list with the elements that follow
    them, and there's nothing after the last element in the list.

    With that in mind, think about how you'd change this code to fix the bug 
    before moving to the next section.
