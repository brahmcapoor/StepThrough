<p>
    Each pair of lines in the Traceback refers to a 
    line of Python code. Once again, we read the 
    Traceback bottom-up.
</p>
<p>
    The two highlighted lines in the terminal provide 
    us several pieces of information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first line tells us that the error is 
        happening in <code>sum_pairs.py</code>,
        on line 14 (which is highlighted on the 
        right), which is a part of the <code>
        sum_pairs</code> function.
    </li>
    <li>
        The second line shows us the contents
        of the line of code in question. 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is the line of code that actually ran into 
    the <code>IndexError</code>. It isn't necessarily 
    where the mistake was made: it might have happened 
    somewhere else in the code and only actually caused 
    an error here, but now we've narrowed down the symptom,
    if not the cause.
