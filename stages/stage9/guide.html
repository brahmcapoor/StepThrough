    Line 14 of the program is likely the culprit,
    since it's the only one of the lines of code 
    which is accessing an index in a list: 
</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <code>pair_sum = lst[i] + lst[i + 1]</code>
</div>
<br />
<p>
    We're using two separate indices in this line: 
    <code>i</code> and <code>i + 1</code>. Either of 
    these might be invalid, and in order to fix our 
    program, we need to identify which index is the 
    problematic one. 
</p>
<p>
    There are several strategies you might reasonably
    choose to employ at this point. Perhaps the most 
    tempting might be to try to reason through the code, 
    and deduce what is causing the program's misbehaviour. 
</p>
<p>
    This isn't a bad idea, and is eventually what we'll 
    turn to. That said, correct and effective deduction relies on 
    plentiful evidence, and we might not have quite enough 
    evidence just yet. For example, line 27 occurs within a 
    <code>for</code> loop, and it's unclear to us which 
    iteration of the <code>for</code> loop the error is 
    occurring in. Luckily, there's one tool you're very 
    familiar with already that can help us collect this 
    evidence: the <code>print</code> function.
